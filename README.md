# INSTALLATION


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/previousnext/agov-profile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/previousnext/agov-profile)

aGov is available as a full drupal site in tgz and zip format at: http://drupal.org/project/agov

Those familiar with drush make can find a build-agov.make file available
in this folder that can be used to build aGov with a command such as:

```
drush make --prepare-install build-agov.make INSTALL_PATH
```

Drupal's 'clean urls' feature is required.
